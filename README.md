Google-Maps-JS-Example
======================

An app that uses many features (Places autocomplete-Geocoding-Overlays[rectangles-circles-markers-custom markers]-DirectionsService-DirectionsRenderer ) of the Google Maps V3 javascript library. Aiming to be a starting point and reference to getting started with Google Maps API.

Getting Started
---------------

Download the code and open Map.html in your favorite browser. 
That's it. 
You will see the things that you can easily do with the Google Maps API and some minimal jQuery UI if you're not design oriented.
The functionality is not important think of it as a showcase for Google Maps features.


Using the code to build stuff with Google Maps
----------------------------------------------

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo, make it better for other people to use.

Use it for your business, for your fun project  remove the code you don't need. Add the features you do need. 
And tell me about it if you want so I can put a link to your website here as a testament to cool things that can be done with maps.
